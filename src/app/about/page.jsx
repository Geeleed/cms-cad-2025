              <p>
                At CAD, we are dedicated to supporting children and families
                impacted by autism and other developmental disorders by adapting
                psychological principles and evidence-based practices from
                abroad to Thailand. Our team is driven by a deep understanding
                of the complexities of children with special needs and is ready
                to empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives, while
                ensuring that all practices are conducted within an ethical
                framework that prioritizes transparency and integrity.
              </p>
