                    Treatment based on Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) focuses
                    on understanding and modifying the behaviors of children
                    with autism and other developmental delays. It aims to
                    reinforce desirable behaviors and reduce inappropriate
                    behaviors, while also helping children learn new skills and
                    build social interactions. ABA treatment is internationally
                    recognized as the most research-supported and evidence-based
                    practice (EBP). It is not only suitable for children with
                    autism but also for children with other developmental
                    disorders, such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
                    (ADHD), speech delays, global developmental delays, sensory
                    processing disorder (SPD), and social, emotional, and
                    behavioral challenges.
