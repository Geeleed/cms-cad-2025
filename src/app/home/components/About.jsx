                  Our learning program is designed and supervised by Board
                  Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBA) - Ms. Dita Chapman and Ms.
                  Prapanit Prapanont (Kru Aum). Both hold degrees in psychology
                  and have extensive experience in teaching children with
                  special needs. The program is based on the Pennsylvania
                  Training and Technical Assistance Network (PaTTAN) model, a
                  teaching standard developed by the Pennsylvania Department of
                  Education, USA. It aims to stimulate development and enhance
                  childrenâ€™s potential through one-on-one sessions, personalized
                  to meet the needs of children with diverse neurological
                  profiles.
